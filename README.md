# Git From Scratch -- Zero to Hero

A hands-on, interactive course for learning Git and GitHub from the ground up. Each module has a short explanation, curated video/doc links, and a lab exercise you practice immediately.

## Prerequisites

- A terminal (bash/zsh)
- Git installed (`git --version`)
- A GitHub account
- GitHub CLI installed (`gh --version`)
- Claude Code (optional, for interactive guided walkthroughs)

## How to Use This Course

### With Claude Code (recommended)

1. Open this folder in Claude Code: `claude` in `~/github/git-from-scratch/`
2. Run `/lab` to start a guided walkthrough of your next module
3. Claude reads your progress, explains concepts, walks you through exercises step by step, and marks modules complete when you're done
4. Jump to a specific module: `/lab 04`

### Without Claude Code

Each lab is fully self-contained -- you don't need Claude to follow along:

1. **Read the lesson** -- open `curriculum/<part>/<module>/lesson.md` for the concept explanation and video links
2. **Run the setup** -- `bash curriculum/<part>/<module>/setup.sh` creates a practice repo in `/tmp/`
3. **Follow the exercises** -- open `lab.md` in the same folder and work through the numbered steps
4. **Check your work** -- each lab has a "Verify" section telling you how to confirm success
5. **Track progress** -- check off completed modules in `progress.md`

Example for Module 01:
```bash
bash curriculum/part-1-foundations/01-what-is-git/setup.sh
# then open curriculum/part-1-foundations/01-what-is-git/lab.md and follow along
```

## Philosophy

- **Short explanations, then practice** -- you learn git by doing, not reading
- **Real scenarios** -- labs simulate actual situations you'll encounter
- **Safe to experiment** -- everything runs in `/tmp/` directories, your real repos are untouched
- **Progressive** -- each module builds on the previous ones

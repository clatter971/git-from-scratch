# Lab 17: Public Repo Best Practices

## Goal

Audit a repository for public readiness -- find secrets buried in history, improve .gitignore, and add LICENSE and CODEOWNERS files.

## Prerequisites

Modules 01-05 (you should be comfortable with commits, git log, and working with files).

## Setup

**Step 1:** Run the setup script (use the full path to the script in your course directory):

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

**Step 2:** Switch to the practice directory:

```bash
cd /tmp/git-lab-17
```

The setup script creates a local repository with a realistic history -- including a deliberately committed secret that was later "removed."

All exercise commands below should be run from `/tmp/git-lab-17`.

## Exercises

### 1. Explore the repository

Look at the current state of the repo:

```bash
ls -la
cat app.py
cat config.py
cat .gitignore
git log --oneline
```

Everything looks clean, right? The config file has "REDACTED" values. But let's dig deeper.

### 2. Search history for secrets

Search the entire git history for common secret patterns:

```bash
git log --all -p -S "password"
```

You should find a commit where a real password was added. Note the commit hash.

### 3. Search for more secret patterns

```bash
git log --all -p -S "API_KEY"
git log --all -p -S "secret"
git log --all -p -S "sk-"
```

You should find an API key that was committed in an early commit.

### 4. Understand the problem

The secrets were "removed" in a later commit -- but they are still in the git history. Run:

```bash
git show <commit-hash-where-secret-was-added>
```

(Use the commit hash you found in step 2.)

Anyone who clones this repo can see the original secrets. **Deleting a file or changing its contents does not erase the old versions from git history.**

### 5. Improve .gitignore

The current `.gitignore` is incomplete. Add patterns for common sensitive files. These are the new patterns being added (after `venv/`):

```
# Secrets and credentials
.env
.env.*
*.pem
*.key
config/secrets.yml
credentials.json

# IDE settings
.vscode/
.idea/

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

This copies the complete updated `.gitignore` (original content plus these new patterns) into place:

```bash
cp /tmp/git-lab-17-files/gitignore-complete .gitignore
```

### 6. Commit the .gitignore improvements

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Improve .gitignore with patterns for secrets, IDE, and OS files"
```

### 7. Add a LICENSE file

Choose a license and create the file. The setup script prepared an MIT license template for you:

```bash
cp /tmp/git-lab-17-files/MIT-LICENSE LICENSE
git add LICENSE
git commit -m "Add MIT license"
```

Edit the `Your Name` placeholder in LICENSE if you want. You can browse other licenses at [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) if MIT is not the right fit.

### 8. Add CODEOWNERS

Create a CODEOWNERS file to require reviews for sensitive paths. The file will contain:

```
# Default owner for everything
* @your-username

# Specific owners for sensitive areas
/config.py @your-username
/.github/ @your-username
/.gitignore @your-username
```

```bash
mkdir -p .github
cp /tmp/git-lab-17-files/CODEOWNERS .github/CODEOWNERS

git add .github/CODEOWNERS
git commit -m "Add CODEOWNERS for review requirements"
```

### 9. Run a final secret audit

Check if the secrets are still in history:

```bash
git log --all -p -S "password"
```

The secret is **still there**. Your `.gitignore` improvements prevent future mistakes, but they cannot erase the past. To truly remove it, you would need to rewrite history with `git filter-repo`.

### 10. Review your public-readiness checklist

```bash
echo "=== Public Readiness Audit ==="
echo ""
echo "LICENSE exists:"
test -f LICENSE && echo "  YES" || echo "  NO -- add one!"
echo ""
echo ".gitignore covers sensitive patterns:"
grep -q "\.env" .gitignore && echo "  YES" || echo "  NO -- update it!"
echo ""
echo "CODEOWNERS exists:"
test -f .github/CODEOWNERS && echo "  YES" || echo "  NO -- add one!"
echo ""
echo "Secrets in history:"
SECRETS_FOUND=$(git log --all -p -S "sk-fake" --oneline | head -1)
if [ -n "$SECRETS_FOUND" ]; then
    echo "  WARNING: Secrets found in history! Must rewrite history before going public."
else
    echo "  Clean -- no secrets detected."
fi
```

## Verify

Confirm the following:

- `.gitignore` includes patterns for `.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, and other sensitive files.
- `LICENSE` file exists in the repo root.
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` file exists.
- `git log --all -p -S "password"` still shows the old secret in history (proving that deletion is not enough).

## Bonus

Install `git-filter-repo` and try rewriting history to remove the committed secret:

```bash
# Install git-filter-repo (if not already installed)
# pip install git-filter-repo

# Remove the config.py file from ALL history
git filter-repo --invert-paths --path config.py --force

# Verify the secret is gone
git log --all -p -S "password"
```

**WARNING:** This rewrites all commit hashes. Never do this on a shared repository without coordinating with your team. In a real scenario, you would also rotate the compromised credentials immediately -- even after removing them from history, assume they were seen.

## Quick Quiz

1. If you delete a file that contains a secret and commit the deletion, is the secret still accessible?
2. Does adding `.env` to `.gitignore` remove a `.env` file that was already committed?
3. What is the only way to truly remove a secret from git history?
